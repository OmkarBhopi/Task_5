Task 5: SQL Joins. 
I used pgAdmin 4 to create two related tables — employee and department — and performed various types of JOIN operations to combine their data.

In this task, I practiced the following SQL joins:

INNER JOIN to retrieve only matching records from both tables

LEFT JOIN to get all employees and their departments, including those without a matching department

RIGHT JOIN to get all departments with or without matching employees

FULL JOIN to retrieve all records from both tables, combining matches and unmatched data

This task helped me understand how to combine data from multiple tables and how different joins behave in real-world scenarios.

The project includes:
A .sql file containing all JOIN queries and a PDF file which contain screenshots of query outputs
